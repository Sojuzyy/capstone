*IMPORTANT NOTE*



Data folder is purely for database purpose only.


It will be divided into 3 categories: model, controller, and service.


Model for database creation like tables, and basic data manipulation like inserting, selecting, and updating data.
Controller for data manipulation especially inserting and getting data from database. As well as deleting data.
Service is for executing the database: calling data from the table, etc.
